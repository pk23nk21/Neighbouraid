"""Tiny in-memory token-bucket rate limiter.

Used for endpoints that are open to the unauthenticated public — primarily
anonymous alert posting. We deliberately don't reach for Redis here:
NeighbourAid is a single-process FastAPI app on Render free tier; an
in-memory bucket is fine, and "exact correctness across replicas" isn't
worth the operational weight at this scale.

If/when you scale horizontally, swap the global `_buckets` dict for a
small wrapper around `redis.Redis.incr` with the same call surface.
