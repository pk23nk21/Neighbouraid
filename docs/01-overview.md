# 1. Overview — what is NeighbourAid?

> *"Your neighbour needs help. Be there in minutes."*

NeighbourAid is a **hyperlocal crisis network** for India. It connects
people in distress (a flooded house, a heart-attack neighbour, a missing
child, a fire on the next block) with **nearby volunteers** in real
time, on a phone or laptop, without anyone needing to install another
app or pay anyone for an API key.

## The problem we're solving

When something bad happens in an Indian neighbourhood, the typical
response is:

1. Call **100 / 108 / 101** and wait for an over-stretched government
   line.
2. Forward a panicked WhatsApp message into half a dozen housing-society
   groups and pray someone nearby sees it.
3. Hope a relative further away has the right contact.

There is **no structured, geolocated, verified** way to reach the
nearest *willing* helpers in real time. Step 2 is the one people
actually rely on, and it has obvious holes — your neighbours might be
asleep, your message might bury under chit-chat, or it might reach
strangers in a different city by accident.

## What NeighbourAid does instead

```
 Reporter posts a crisis             AI triages urgency      WebSocket push
 (text + GPS + optional photos)  ──►  CRITICAL/HIGH/      ──►  Volunteers
                                       MEDIUM/LOW              within 5–15 km

 Open-Meteo → live weather            witness corroboration       Accept
                                       feed a 0–100                Resolve
                                       verified_score              Update
```

Five things make NeighbourAid different from a WhatsApp group:

1. **Geofenced delivery** — the alert reaches volunteers within 5 km of
   the incident, not your entire contact list. Skill-tagged volunteers
   get a wider 15 km bubble.
2. **AI urgency triage** — every alert runs through a local Hugging
   Face model that classifies it as `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or
   `LOW`, plus detects the language, vulnerability (child / elderly /
   pregnant), and time-sensitivity. No paid AI APIs.
3. **Multi-source verification** — every alert carries a
   `verified_score` (0–100) derived from independent signals: community
   witnesses, corroborating reports nearby, live weather, and photo
   evidence.
4. **Built for India** — trilingual UI (English / हिन्दी / ਪੰਜਾਬੀ),
   auto-translation between them, India emergency dialer (112 / 100 /
   108 / …), and an optional WhatsApp inbound bridge.
5. **Free and offline-tolerant** — zero paid dependencies. Alerts can
   be queued in the browser when the network drops and auto-deliver
   when it comes back.

## Two kinds of users

| Role | What they do |
|---|---|
| **Reporter** | Posts a crisis. Has a "My Alerts" dashboard. Can attach photos. Can use Quick SOS for one-tap broadcast. |
| **Volunteer** | Receives nearby alerts in real time. Accepts → optionally publishes ETA → resolves. Has a trust score. |

A user picks their role at registration. They can switch later by
making a new account — roles aren't mutually exclusive in real life,
but mixing them in one account complicates the UI more than it helps.
