# 8. Testing

The project has **143 tests** total: 99 backend (pytest) + 44 frontend
(Vitest). Both suites run in CI on every push/PR.

---

## 8.1 Backend (pytest)

### Running

```bash
cd backend
NA_DISABLE_AI_MODEL=1 pytest tests/ -v
```

`NA_DISABLE_AI_MODEL=1` skips loading the 1.6 GB HF model — the
tests exercise the keyword-fallback path explicitly, so this is
correct in CI and dev.

### With coverage

```bash
NA_DISABLE_AI_MODEL=1 pytest tests/ -v --cov=app --cov-report=term --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html   # macOS; or just open it in a browser
```

Current overall coverage: **~67 %**. Big gaps are intentional:
- `services/photo.py` — only the `analyze_photos` happy path is
  covered; Pillow corner cases would need real test fixtures.
- `services/news.py` — RSS scraping is mocked, the full network
  fetch path isn't covered.
- `services/geocode.py` / `weather.py` — external HTTP, mocked at
  call sites in routes.

### Test files

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `test_auth.py` | register, login, validation |
| `test_alerts.py` | CRUD, role guards, witness, invalid IDs, share-link, heatmap, ETA |
| `test_endpoints_extras.py` | photos endpoint, flag endpoint, profile patch, webhook payload |
| `test_new_features.py` | trust score, escalation, rate limiter, resources, inbound, responder tracking |
| `test_news_service.py` | authenticity scoring, topic detection, domain matching |
| `test_photo_service.py` | photo evidence pipeline (Pillow real images) |
| `test_stats_users.py` | landing-page stats, user me, news endpoint |
| `test_verification.py` | composite scoring, weather match, AI heuristic fallback |
| `test_websocket_routing.py` | `ConnectionManager` skill-aware broadcast |

### Mock pattern

`tests/conftest.py` provides a `client` fixture that swaps the
real Mongo client for a `MagicMock`. Tests configure individual
mocked methods per case — e.g.:

```python
db.alerts.find_one = AsyncMock(return_value={"_id": ObjectId(), ...})
db.alerts.insert_one = AsyncMock(return_value=MagicMock(inserted_id=ObjectId()))
```

For cursors, build a chainable `MagicMock` whose `.sort` / `.limit`
methods return an async generator. Pattern is repeated several
times in `test_alerts.py` — copy-paste it.

### Running a single test

```bash
pytest tests/test_alerts.py::test_get_nearby_is_public -v
```

### Markers

The suite uses `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = auto` (set in
`pytest.ini`), so any `async def test_*` is auto-marked. No need to
add `@pytest.mark.asyncio` manually on async tests.

## 8.2 Frontend (Vitest + Testing Library)

### Running

```bash
cd frontend
npm test            # one-shot
npm run test:watch  # interactive watch mode
```

### Test files

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `utils/error.test.js` | apiError flattening, axios shapes |
| `utils/translate.test.js` | gtx success, cache, fallback, LS persistence |
| `utils/photo.test.js` | approxKb, compress non-image rejection |
| `utils/offlineQueue.test.js` | enqueue, retry, drop after 10 attempts |
| `utils/i18n.test.jsx` | language switch, fallback to English |
| `hooks/useVoiceAlert.test.js` | locale mapping, supported flag, default-on, persistence |
| `components/Button.test.jsx` | variants, loading, disabled |
| `components/Skeleton.test.jsx` | shimmer primitive, list role |
| `components/AutoDispatch.test.jsx` | category-specific tel: links |

### How the test environment is set up

`src/test/setup.js` runs before every test file. It:

- Adds `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers (`toBeInTheDocument`, etc).
- Stubs jsdom holes:
  - `matchMedia`
  - `IntersectionObserver`
  - `<canvas>` `getContext` / `toDataURL`
  - `FileReader.readAsDataURL`
  - `<img>.src` (auto-fires onload with default 800×600 dims)
  - `navigator.geolocation`
  - `Notification`
  - `SpeechRecognition`
- Resets `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` between tests via
  `afterEach(cleanup)`.

`fake-indexeddb` is auto-imported in `offlineQueue.test.js` so the
IDB-backed queue is testable without a real browser.

### Patterns

**Component tests** use Testing Library's user-centric queries:

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'

render(<Button onClick={onClick}>Go</Button>)
await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'))
```

**Hook tests** use `renderHook` + `act`:

```js
import { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react'

const { result } = renderHook(() => useVoiceAlert())
act(() => result.current.setEnabled(false))
```

**Network calls** mock `global.fetch`:

```js
global.fetch = vi.fn(async () => ({
  ok: true,
  json: async () => [...],
}))
```

## 8.3 CI

The workflow is at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Four jobs:

1. **`backend-test`** — matrix on Python 3.11 + 3.12. Installs deps,
   runs ruff (`E9,F63,F7,F82` only — show-stoppers), pytest with
   coverage, uploads coverage XML as artifact.
2. **`frontend-lint`** — `npm ci`, lint, **`npm test`**, build,
   upload `dist/` as artifact.
3. **`security-audit`** — non-blocking (`continue-on-error: true` +
   `|| true` on each step). Runs `pip-audit` and `npm audit
   --audit-level=high`. Findings appear in the step log without
   failing the build.
4. **`docker-build`** — gated on `backend-test + frontend-lint`.
   Builds both Dockerfiles with GHA cache.

`concurrency` is set so push spam cancels in-flight runs of the
same ref. `permissions: contents: read` keeps the runner least-priv.

## 8.4 Adding a new test

### Backend

1. Pick or create `tests/test_<area>.py`.
2. If the test needs the FastAPI client, accept the `client`
   fixture: `async def test_x(client): c, db = client; ...`.
3. Mock any DB call you actually use. Don't mock things the route
   doesn't touch — the test will pass without you noticing the
   mock is wrong.
4. Run `pytest tests/test_<area>.py::test_x -v` until green.

### Frontend

1. Place the test next to the file it covers, named `*.test.js` or
   `*.test.jsx`.
2. If the file imports something jsdom doesn't ship (Web Speech,
   etc.), add a stub to `src/test/setup.js`.
3. Run `npm test`.

## 8.5 What's *not* tested

Be aware of these gaps:

- **Real browser smoke test** — there's no Cypress / Playwright
  suite. The Service Worker, Leaflet map, geolocation, and
  notification permission flows aren't exercised end-to-end.
- **Real WebSocket roundtrip** — the `ConnectionManager` is
  unit-tested, but the FastAPI WebSocket endpoint glue (auth →
  first-frame parsing → register) only has integration coverage
  via manual smoke testing.
- **Photo compression on realistic JPEGs** — the test stubs
  `<canvas>.toDataURL` to a fixed string, so we don't actually
  measure the budget loop's behaviour on real images.

If you're tightening the test surface, those are the next three
places to look.
